Hello, and welcome to "Not-So-Final Fantasy"
@
@
All classes have three specialized attacks,
and
@
both these and their basic stats
are slightly different from one another.
@
@
Please open the "Classes" text file included in the folder 
if you wish to read 
@
up on the basic stats and abilities.
@
@
In general,
@
-Strength makes a character hit harder.
@
-Defense reduces the damage taken.
@
-Accuracy improves chances to hit vital points.
@
-Luck increases chances to escape or not encounter
 enemies.
@
-Speed improves chances to escape.

@
You start out with two HP and two AP potions- HP potions 
can be used in combat 
@
to heal your character for 25 HP, whereas 
the AP potions will restore 20 AP to 
@
your ability points.
@
@
Use W, A, S, and D to move around, 
or E to interact with the Omega symbol (boss) on the third floor
 and to open doors(D) to change rooms.
